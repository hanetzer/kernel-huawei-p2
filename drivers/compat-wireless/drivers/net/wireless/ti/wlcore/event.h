/*
 * Mbox events
 *
 * The event mechanism is based on a pair of event buffers (buffers A and
 * B) at fixed locations in the target's memory. The host processes one
 * buffer while the other buffer continues to collect events. If the host
 * is not processing events, an interrupt is issued to signal that a buffer
 * is ready. Once the host is done with processing events from one buffer,
 * it signals the target (with an ACK interrupt) that the event buffer is
 * free.
